# Meeting

#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

Pretty clear agenda.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good/Excellent

Feedback: 

Looks pretty clear, but hard to judge as I was not at previous meeting. 

#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- Very small meeting so not much to do for chair. Went through the agenda perfectly fine.
- When going through backlog, it is probably easier to go through the issue version of the backlog so anything covered in previous weeks is already removed from that backlog. Then you only have to go through open backlog.
- Chair sometimes forgets to check with the person joining online.


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

No problems

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Good/Excellent

Feedback: 

Fine quick overview of changes since last time, but hard to say much about this as I have not seen previous version.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Good/Excellent

Feedback: 

All people present seems to be active, but clear group leader who also does the most work. Not necessarily a problem though.
