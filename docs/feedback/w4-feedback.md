# Meeting

#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

Agenda was well written and very easy to prepare for. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

Meeting notes were merged into the agenda which is very nice, action points were very clear and easy to follow. My only issue with it is that there is no clear divide of agenda and minutes, maybe separating things with a header would work well.


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Excellent 

Feedback: 

Chair covered all of the topics in a timely manner and made sure everyone contributed in the conversation.


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

The team handled the meeting well, everyone contributed and the atmosphere was constructive.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

There was a lot of progress from last week, with a very basic prototype but promising!
The team is on a good track to create a working application.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- Within the group, most people completed the tasks assigned to them last week.
- One person is sticking out *a lot*. It would be nice if next week they did more commits/issues.
- Tasks seem like they are going to be distributed evenly to a degree.
