# Meeting
#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback:

The agenda was added a bit late to the repository, but that was due to git issues so it's fine. Otherwise it followed the template and seems fairly clear.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good

Meeting notes were merged into the agenda. There were a good amount of notes that were clear. Only complaint is that there were no action points written for the next week.

Chair made sure that all of the topics in the agenda were coevered in an appropriate amount of time.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

The team presented the current state of their application, it seemed potentially shippable and there was a lot of progress compared to when i graded for usability.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 

There was no action list for last week and I was not sure what the goal of everyone was. But contribution feels equal.
